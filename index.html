					<h3>Welcome</h3>
					<p>I am an Associate Professor of <a href="http://www.cs.uga.edu">Computer Science</a> at the
						University of Georgia (<a href="http://www.uga.edu">UGA</a>), and a member of Large Scale
						Distributed Information Systems (<a href="http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu">LSDIS</a>) Lab. I received my
						BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees from <a href="http://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/">Computer Engineering
							Department</a> of <a href="http://www.metu.edu.tr/">Middle East Technical University</a> in
						1991, 1993, and 1998 respectively (advisors: <a

					<h3>Research Interests</h3>
					<p>My current research interests include <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">semantic web</a>,
						crowdsourcing and collective intelligence, information fusion, and biomedical informatics. My
						earlier research involved web services and workflow management. My research focuses on
						developing new semantic-based techniques for providing better information integration and search
						experiences for web users. This research direction is critical for building the next generation
						of the web, called <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">semantic web.</a> From December 1998
						through August 2001, I worked on adaptable <a
							href="http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/Projects/past/METEOR/">workflow</a> technology during my
						post-doctoral studies at <a href="http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu">LSDIS</a> Lab, which is one of the
						leading information systems research labs worldwide (advisor: <a

							href="http://www.ovpr.uga.edu/ugarf/">UGA Research Foundation</a> and <a
							href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> respectively. I have authored or
						co-authored over seventy <a href="publications.html">publications</a>, and the <a
							href="research.html">R&amp;D</a> I was involved in has resulted in different products or
						research prototypes.</p>
					<h3>An Invitation</h3>
					<p>I consider training <a href="students.html">students</a> in and beyond the class and helping
						their scholarly and personal progress as very important objectives in my career. If you have an
						interest in web science, linked data, semantic web, and collective intelligence and would like

				<strong>Title</strong>: <a href="papers/phdthesis.pdf">Formalization of Workflows and Correctness Issues
					in the Presence of Concurrency</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Supervisors</strong>: <a href="http://www.srdc.metu.edu.tr/%7Easuman">Prof. Asuman Dogac</a>,

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Abstract</strong>:
			</p>
			<p> In this thesis, main components of a workflow system that are relevant to the correctness in the
				presence of concurrency are formalized based on set theory and graph theory. The formalization which
				constitutes the theoretical basis of the correctness criterion provided can be summarized as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Activities of a workflow are represented through a notation based on set theory to make it possible
					to formalize the conceptual grouping of activities. </li>
				<li> Control-flow is represented as a special graph based on this set definition, and it includes serial
					composition, parallel composition, conditional branching, and nesting of individual activities and
					conceptual activities themselves. </li>
				<li> Data-flow is represented as a directed acyclic graph in conformance with the control-flow graph.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p> The formalization of correctness of concurrently executing workflow instances is based on this framework
				by defining two categories of constraints on the workflow environment with which the workflow instances
				and their activities interact. These categories are: </p>
			<ul>
				<li> Basic constraints that specify the correct states of a workflow environment. </li>
				<li> Inter-activity constraints that define the semantic dependencies among activities such as an
					activity requiring the validity of a constraint that is set or verified by a preceding activity.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Basic constraints graph and inter-activity constraints graph which are in conformance with the
				control-flow and data-flow graphs are then defined to represent these constraints. These graphs are used
				in formalizing the intervals among activities where an
				inter-activity constraint should be maintained and the intervals where a basic constraint remains
				invalid. </p>
				<img src="img/odtu-wall3.jpg" height="215" width="288" 
					alt="Example image - aligned to the right">
			<p> A correctness criterion is defined for an interleaved execution of workflow instances using the
				constraints graphs. Two concurrency control mechanisms, namely Constraint Based Concurrency Control
				technique and Constraint Locking Concurrency Control technique are developed based on the correctness
				criterion. The performance analysis shows the superiority of the proposed techniques. Other possible
				approaches to the problem are also presented.

			<strong>Title</strong>: An Advanced Graphical User Interface for Object-Oriented DBMSs: MoodView <br>
			<br>
			<strong>Supervisor</strong>: <a href="http://www.srdc.metu.edu.tr/%7Easuman">Prof. Asuman Dogac</a>
			<p>
				<br>
				<strong>Abstract</strong>:
			</p>
			<p>OODBMSs need more than declarative query languages and programming languages as their interfaces since
				they are designed and implemented for complex applications requiring more advanced and easy to use
				visual interfaces. A complete programming environment called MoodView is developed for this purpose.
				MoodView translates all the user actions performed through its graphical interface to SQL statements and
				therefore it can be ported onto any object-oriented database systems using SQL. MoodView provides the
				database programmer with tools and functionalities for every phase of object-oriented database
				application development. Current version of MoodView allows a database user to design, browse, and
				modify database schema interactively and to display class inheritance hierarchy as a directed acyclic
				graph. MoodView can automatically generate graphical displays for complex and multimedia database
				objects which can be updated through the object browser.
